# Cardigan
A HypeCard clone I'm writing in Svelte. Contributors welcome!

## What's with the name?
A play on words. "Card Again" ;-)

## What's HyperCard?
[It's all here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard). Truly a work of art created by [Bill Atkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Atkinson) for Apple in the 1987, with iconography by [Susan Kare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Kare).
